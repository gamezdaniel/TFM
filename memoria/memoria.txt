1. INTRODUCTION
  - Document structure, the way the dissertation is going to be organized

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

  There is a problem in ___________(societal organization). 
  Despite _________________ (something that should be happening) ___________ is occurring. 
  [provided supporting evidence]. 
  This problem has negatively impacted ____________(victims of problem) because _________________. 
  A possible cause of this problem is ___________.
  Perhaps a study which investigates ___________ by ________(paradigm/method) could remedy the situation.

  * Describe the "ideal" state of affairs
  - Start by describing how things should work. 
  - Before you even mention your problem, explain in a few sentences how things would be if the problem didn't exist

  * Explain your problem
  - Succinctly summarize the problem you intend to solve
  - "However, ..." to show that the problem you've identified is what is preventing the ideal vision from being a reality

  * Explain your problem's financial costs?
  - Explain why it's a big deal, no one has the time or resources to try to solve every single minor problem
  - In the business world, money is almost always the bottom line, so you'll want to try to highlight the financial impact of your problem on the company or organization
  - Is it damaging your brand image and thus indirectly costing your business money? (i.e. SLAs)

  * Back up your assertions
  - Propose reasonable evidence
  - From your own research, from data from a related study or project, or even from reputable third-party sources

  * Propose a solution
  - Explanation of the solution should be written to be as clear and concise as possible
  - Stick to big, important, concrete concepts and leave any minor details for later

  * Explain the benefits of the solution
  - Explain why this solution is a good idea
  - Which new forms of revenue it will generate (quality services to customers)

  * Conclude by summarizing the problem and solution
  - Conclude with a summary of your main arguments that allows you transition easily into the main body of your proposal
  - State in just a few sentences
