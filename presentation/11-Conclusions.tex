\begin{itemize}
  \item Implications about adopting a cloud infrastructure should be considered (benefits and side effects)
  \item Use of correct technologies directly impact over business continuity
  \item Companies nowadays demand agile decisions at adopting new technologies
  \item Within the significance and contribution of this research are:\\
  - An actual solution for the stated problem has been provided\\
  - Current implementation serves as a reference point for further deployments\\
  - F$\ell$OSS standalone tools are an alternative to enterprise solutions depending on many factors
  \item For a more comprehensive analysis other tools can be used:\\
  - OpenBRR, QSoS, QualOSS, OSMM
  \item Other F$\ell$OSS technologies to considerate in order to provide HA for similar environments are:\\
  - OpenStack, Cloudstack, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, Docker, among many others
